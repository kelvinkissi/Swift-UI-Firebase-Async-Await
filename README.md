## COMPLETE User Login / Sign Up App


The [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) section is responsible for managing Email, User ID, and account information.

[Cloud Firestore/Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzo2mBhAUEiwAf7wjkrbqeXQWC42eUZrdRYAtenQ7_TmGS7MORaW8HjiYQj-AZVVe0MzpxRoCdV0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) serves as the storage for user details such as Email, Full Name, Title, and Phone Number. Additionally, it facilitates retrieval of this information when a user logs into the application. This forms the fundamental basis for any application that involves user profile storage and authentication. It's a versatile feature that can be easily integrated into any app requiring authentication.

[GoogleServiceinfo](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) enables the app to establish communication with Google's servers.
